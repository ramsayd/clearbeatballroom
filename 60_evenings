Why is the website called Clear Beat?
</div>
<p>
When we startaed dancing we liked a clear beat, when we started to run a dance and set up the website we called it; Clearbeat.
</p><p>From the review of the music you will see that just over half of our music is vocals, but they are not ones where the singer's voice drowns out the music. In addition none of them have such a heavy beat that they become monotonous to listen to.
